Non-Linear Modelling And Positioning (NLMAP) Library
====================================================


What is NLMAP?
--------------

The files distributed with this README constitute the NLMAP
library. This is a small C++ library that can non-linearly model any
data using the Levenberg-Marquardt method i.e. fit a non-linear
function to a data series and estimate the fit. In particular it
provides functions to use the technique to position objects using
multilateration or multiangulation.

History of NLMAP 
---------------- 

I wrote NLMAP following the realisation that very few people seem
able to write robust multilateration algorithms that gave the best
results from their data. Having worked with a high accuracy
positioning system during my PhD I decided to write an algorithm from
scratch, free of intellectual property issues and make it generally
available.

Requirements
------------

NLMAP requires little other than a standards-compliant C++ compiler
